## Known Issues
This Snap is being actively developed. There are a few known bugs we are currently working through:

* After pairing with your account, Mycroft will immediately report that it is ready. There may still be some setup processes finalizing and Mycroft may not respond to commands immediately. Please give it a few more minutes to finish setting up.
* An `OSError` will be raised for each installation using PIP. This should not affect your usage of the system.
Additional command line tools such as the Mycroft Skills Manager are not yet available. Skills can be installed by voice:  
_"Hey Mycroft, install Dice Skill"_  
Or by typing directly in the Mycroft CLI:  
_"install https://github.com/author/skill-repo"_
* The wake word response time may also be slower than expected. This is the time between you saying "Hey Mycroft" and Mycroft acknowledging and starting to record.
